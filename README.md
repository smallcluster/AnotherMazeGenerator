Python being the **FASTEST** 🚀 language known to man, you can take the coffee break **YOU** 🫵 deserve and get your self a nice maze with its generation and solving steps in a video when you come back 🥳

## Requirements

- Python 3+
- pip

Install the required libraries:

```

## Usage

### Help

To show all CLI options use the `-h` option:

```shell
python maze.py -h
```

### Visualize the algorithms

If an image is specified, one can use the `-v` option to generate a mp4 video showing the maze generation and maze solving.

Example:

```shell
python maze.py -o example.png -v
```
